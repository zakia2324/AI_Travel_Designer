# AI_Travel_Designer
its a travel designer ai agent created by me using python, chainlit

Using Python and Chainlit, I built an AI-powered Travel Designer Agent that handles trip planning through modular sub-agents. One agent specializes in recommending destinations based on user preferences, while another focuses on flight booking. Through seamless tool handoff, the system dynamically transfers control between agents, ensuring a smooth and personalized travel planning experience.
